# Unity Basics and Physics

## Download the Demo folder

You can download the demo folder here and open it in Unity to look around the scene, open commented scripts and get some examples of some funcitonality you can incorporate into your own game

## Read Code

If you're only interested in code, then navigate to Demo/Assets/Scripts and look through the folders in there to see different types of scripts

## Play the Demo

You can try out the demo and play the game if you wish. 
### Controls
* **Movement**: WASD or Arrow Key movement
* **Look**: Look around with lock There's no maximum cap, so make sure you don't look too far up/down or you'll be upside down (Maybe see if you can extend the "Look" script to stop this?)
* **Pickup/Drop Axe**: Press E to pickup Axe when you're close enough and Q to drop it.
